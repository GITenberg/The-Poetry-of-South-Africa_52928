<p class="nind"><span class="letra">T</span>HIS collection of verse has been made from various sources in the Cape
Colony, Natal, and the Transvaal, and it is a matter of regret that many
pieces of interest have been omitted owing to the difficulty of
obtaining copies. Also as most colonists in South Africa understand the
Dutch language “as spoken there,” it could be wished that certain
well-known productions in the “Boerentaal” could have been preserved in
these pages. Some of the inimitable “versions” of Reitz,&mdash;for instance,
his rendering of “Tam o’ Shanter” and “The Maid of Athens,” and some
others which have appeared from time to time, we believe, in one of the
Cape journals, ought not to be forgotten.</p>

<p>We have received from Natal, since this volume was “in the press,” some
lines by the late T. Fannin, who used in the olden days to sing his own
rhymes in right<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_vi" id="page_vi"></a>{vi}</span> good style. We do not apologise to our readers for
giving these in their entirety.</p>

<h3>“THE SMOUSE.”</h3>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“I’m a Smouse, I’m a Smouse in the wilderness wide&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The veld is my home, and the wagon’s my pride;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The crack of my “voerslag,” shall sound o’er the lea.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">I’m a Smouse, I’m a Smouse, and the trader is free!<br /></span>
<span class="i1">I heed not the Governor, I fear not his law,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">I care not for ‘civilisation’ (?) one straw&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And ne’er to ‘Ompanda’&mdash;‘Umgazis’ I’ll throw,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">While my arm carries fist, or my foot bears a toe!<br /></span>
<span class="i1">‘Trek,’ ‘trek,’ ply the whip,&mdash;touch the fore oxen’s skin,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">I’ll warrant we’ll ‘go it’ through thick and through thin&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">‘Loop! loop ye oud skellums! ot Vigmaan trek jy.’<br /></span>
<span class="i1">I’m a Smouse, I’m a Smouse, and the trader is free!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">They may talk of quick going by mail or by rail&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">What matters? our wagon creeps on like a snail;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">What to ‘her’ is the steam-engine’s whistle and din?<br /></span>
<span class="i1">We have time all before, and the ‘prog’ all within&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The snows of Kathlamba our progress can’t stay;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">We mount to its summit, and travel away,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Or go we by Biggarsberg&mdash;wagon upset,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The tent lies in atoms, the stuff is all wet&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Never mind, that won’t hurt us&mdash;we’ll soon get it dry.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">But ho! there go Elands&mdash;saddle up, boys! mount! fly!<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Load your rifles, give chase as they bound o’er the lea&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">I’m a Smouse, I’m a Smouse, and the trader is free!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">I’m alone&mdash;I’m alone, and ’tis night on the plain&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And I think, as I lie, of old England again;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The jackal cries round me, the wolf quits his lair,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And the roar of the lion resounds through the air&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">‘Alamagtig!’ cries Jansi&mdash;‘Ma-wo!’ cries Kewitt;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The cattle stand trembling&mdash;the Smouse on his feet.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_vii" id="page_vii"></a>{vii}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i1">My ‘Lancaster’ rings, while the brute gives a bound,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And the king of the desert lies dead on the ground!<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Hurrah! then, what care I for king or for prince?<br /></span>
<span class="i1">My horse and my gun are my pride and defence;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The town for the coward&mdash;the desert for me!<br /></span>
<span class="i1">I’m a Smouse, I’m a Smouse, and the trader is free!”<br /></span>

<p>All is changed since these lines were written, and since Pringle (the
“father” of South African verse) “sang” amid the wild surroundings of
his home. The whistle of the locomotive has taken the place of the
shrill cry of the Kaffir. The lion has retired from business. The “big
game” which used to cover the plains beyond the Drachensberg has gone,
never to return; and the wandering trader has to pay taxes, and is no
longer in need of a gun. The railway from Delagoa Bay to the Portuguese
border is almost completed. Soon “excursions to Ophir” will be
advertised, and the romance of the “Dark Continent” will be dead! There
is little time for thought or rest in a country which can show a town
risen up, as by Aladdin’s power, in a few short months, holding five
thousand people, all gathered together for one object&mdash;gold.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Still,
and in spite of all this, we hope our modest volume may not be wholly
neglected, but will find a welcome in many a home. There must be
“intervals for refreshment,” however transient, both for body and mind,
even in a world where the “go as you please”<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_viii" id="page_viii"></a>{viii}</span> race for wealth engages
everybody, and we trust that many colonists will find something in these
pages to satisfy their tastes even if it be only a reminder of the days
when their fathers were young, and ventured over the sea to make for
themselves homes in untrodden wilds.</p>

<span class="i0">Like a funeral pall for a night of doom;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The landscape was vested with softer green,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">That was making a sin-struck spirit cower.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But the storm swept by;&mdash;the lightning dread<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Left all unscathed my guilty head,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the dark cloud melted as it passed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In showers of blessing, while the blast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sank to the whisper of mercy’s voice,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That bade the trembling soul rejoice<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In peace and pardon, light and love.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I looked;&mdash;’twas a starlit heaven above!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bright-eyed angels seemed to gaze<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In smiling myriads through the rays;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To watch the sinner’s heaving breast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And mark how its terrors sank to rest.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then the light of angel eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Melted away in the brightening skies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As silent, soothing, gently stole<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sense of pardon on the soul,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For <i>now</i> ’twas God’s own smile that beamed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the rays of His mercy around me streamed;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Firm and resolved his mien, and calm his words,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though death was nigh him, and he saw it:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i15">The camp stormed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By overwhelming myriads, and the yells<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of savage victors ringing in his ears<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Demon-like, while they drowned the dying groans<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of hundreds, sinking low beneath the stroke<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the blood-reeking Zulu assegai;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O’erwhelmed, but <i>not</i> dishonoured.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Yet, heedless of their fall, had <i>thousands</i> more<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Recklessly trampled them in onward rush,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And wild contempt of death.<br /></span>
<span class="i15">As the surf breaks<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Rolls its dark waves,&mdash;<i>its</i> dead, as yet, unmissed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With thousands in reserve to fill their place.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Man after man the British soldier falls,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Falls where he stood,&mdash;his right arm’s strength exhausted,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his <i>dead</i> foes hurled on his bayonet’s point,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To clear the way for others!<br /></span>
<span class="i15"><span class="smcap">Pulleine</span> saw<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His own end near,&mdash;and gave his dying charge:&mdash;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">“Men of the 24th. <i>I</i> stay with <i>you</i>;&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We bide it to the end.”&mdash;A ringing cheer<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Of succour nerves their arm, they face the foe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till men and their commander sink together,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And join in death their comrades gone before.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">In savage triumph proudly borne away<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With battle song of victory, upraised<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By myriad voices ’mongst the echoing hills,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Leagues must he traverse of a hostile land<br /></span>

<span class="i0">There crosses still his path, and bars his way,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The river boundary in summer flood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The swirling waters as they rush and roar,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mock at the wearied limbs that reach their banks,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Or has he dared the river with his charge?<br /></span>

<small>OF THE GUTTER LATELY FILLED UP BY AN UNPOETICAL MUNICIPALITY.</small></h2>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="hang">Old residents of Port Elizabeth will remember the kloof running
down between Donkin Street and Constitution Hill, which was spanned
by a rude wooden foot-bridge just opposite Dr. Edwards’ residence.
The kloof having been filled up now forms the site of the row of
houses on the right-hand side of Donkin Street. This municipal
improvement forms the subject of the following pitiful “Lament.”
Whatever may be thought of the merit of the verses, the author
takes some credit for an eye to the “practical,” for the attempt to
lead off the surface water through an underground culvert, resulted
in the catastrophe predicted in the concluding verses within a very
short time after the completion of the work.</p></div>

<span class="i0">With a pop, and a hiss, and a nasty scent.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And as it went out a ghost walked in!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An orthodox ghost, with a churchyard grin;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">From the head to the feet<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And Timothy’s eyeballs glare and stare,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And up on end goes Timothy’s hair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Timothy shivers with agitation,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his body’s quite damp with perspiration&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A common effect of consternation.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">

<span class="i4">With a resolute air,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">He cries, “Who’s there?”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the vision solemnly answers “Bill!”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bill! Bill who? Bill Smith? Bill Jones?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For Bill’s a prænomen each family owns;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So Timothy tries with might and main<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To guess which Bill, but all in vain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till, shaking with horror through and through,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He faintly stammers out “Bill who?”<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The ghostly accents seem to fill<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The room as they answer, “Christmas Bill!<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Was very much paler and very much thinner<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Though afterwards Tadpole remarked it as “rum,” he<br /></span>

<span class="i0">As solemn and grave as an undertaker<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">This ghost had an air so dapper and nice, he<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Looked for a spirit uncommonly spicy;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">As if with a look he’d annihilate <i>him</i>,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in accents severe cried, “I’d have you to know, sir,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">If you don’t pretty speedily fork out the rhino!”<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But alas and alack! a new one appears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The tailor’s bill, armed with the goose and the shears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the bill of the bootmaker, gliding together;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">The latter quite “larking,”<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And pertly remarking,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Come, dub up, old fellow, there’s nothing like leather.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the bill of the wine merchant, troubled with hiccups,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the bill of the hosier for collars called “stick-ups.”<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">And round about his bed they flew<br /></span>

<span class="i4">And tickled his toes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And rained on his cheeks hard pinches and blows;<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">

<span class="i4">The air was rent<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With their shouting and yelling, and thus they gave vent:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">“Pay us you must,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">His tongue was on fire&mdash;his head, how it burned!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He struggled and kicked, gave a desperate roar<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The ghosts have slipped off, having finished their fun.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">Free from his terror, but <i>not</i> free from pain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The shades of the night like the spirits are flitting,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Grey dawn on the tops of the mountains is sitting,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Oh! what an asinine chorus greeted the hero’s returning!<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Disgust they mistook for defeat, contempt they imagined was chagrin,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What bad living did for our hero, they fancied their wit had accomplished.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Contempt and disgust are too dignified weapons for poor abject Bunkum,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still they bray o’er their own self-deception&mdash;while Dobson sits calm in his garden<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Smoking his dudeen, the calumet of a sound head and clear conscience,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He knows, though his figures were stolen and mischievously mutilated,<br /></span>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The Pyramid which forms the subject of the following lines is the
most prominent historical monument of Port Elizabeth. It stands on
the brow of the hill overlooking Algoa Bay, in an open space known
as the “Donkin Reserve.” It is built of rough stone and is about 35
feet in height, each side of the base being about 25 feet. On its
western side a slate tablet is inserted exhibiting the following
inscription:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Elizabeth Frances, Lady Donkin, eldest daughter of Dr. George
Markham, Dean of York, died at Merat, in Upper Hindostan, of a
fever, after seven days’ illness, on the 21st August 1818, aged not
quite 28 years. She left an infant in his seventh month, too young
to know the unequalled loss he had sustained, and a husband whose
heart is still wrung by undiminished grief, he erected this
Pyramid, August 1820.”</p>

<p>On its eastern side a similar tablet appears exhibiting the
following:&mdash;</p>

<p>“To the memory of one of the most perfect of human beings, who has
given her name to the town below.”</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free

(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
